# Spring Boot API Integration: Troubleshooting and Optimization  

This repository focuses on addressing common technical challenges encountered during API integration in Spring Boot applications. It provides detailed solutions and best practices for working with JSON data, configuring REST clients, and debugging errors in real-world integration scenarios.  

## Overview  

Spring Boot simplifies API integration, but working with external APIs often brings challenges such as handling complex JSON payloads, managing HTTP client configurations, and debugging deserialization issues. This guide is designed to provide actionable insights into solving these technical problems with a strong focus on practical implementation.

## Technical Focus  

### **1. Mapping JSON to Java Objects**  
- Using **Jackson Annotations** for accurate field mapping:  
  - `@JsonProperty` for property name mismatches between JSON and Java fields.  
  - `@JsonIgnore` and `@JsonInclude` to control ignored fields or handle null values during serialization/deserialization.  
- Handling **nested JSON structures** with custom deserializers and mix-in annotations.  
- Utilizing **records** in Java 14+ to streamline immutable object mapping.  
- Debugging with `ObjectMapper` to test custom deserialization logic.  

### **2. Deserialization and Serialization Challenges**  
- Resolving `HttpMessageNotReadableException` caused by:  
  - Missing or unexpected fields in API responses.  
  - Incorrect data types in the JSON payload.  
  - Customizing deserialization for complex structures with `JsonDeserializer` or `@JsonFormat`.  
- Preventing `JsonMappingException` with proper exception handling and fallback defaults.  
- Addressing type-erasure issues in generic collections (e.g., `List<T>` or `Map<String, T>`) using `TypeReference`.  

### **3. Spring Boot REST Client Configuration**  
- **RestTemplate** configuration for:  
  - Connection pool management using `HttpClient` or `OkHttpClient`.  
  - Setting timeouts (`setConnectTimeout`, `setReadTimeout`) to avoid hanging API calls.  
  - Adding interceptors for logging, authentication, or request transformations.  
- **WebClient** for reactive programming:  
  - Configuring connection pools with `ConnectionProvider` and `HttpClient`.  
  - Setting retry policies for transient network errors using `retryWhen`.  
  - Parsing and validating response bodies using `onStatus` and `exchangeToMono`.  

### **4. Unit Testing and Mocking API Calls**  
- Mocking API responses with:  
  - `MockRestServiceServer` for testing `RestTemplate`.  
  - `WebTestClient` for verifying `WebClient` interactions.  
  - Using `WireMock` or `MockServer` for end-to-end integration testing with controlled API responses.  
- Writing tests for JSON serialization/deserialization using `JacksonTester` and `@JsonTest`.  
- Handling edge cases such as:  
  - Missing fields in JSON payloads.  
  - Invalid response formats.  
  - Timeouts and retries during HTTP calls.  

### **5. Debugging HTTP Message Conversion Issues**  
- Common exceptions and their resolutions:  
  - `HttpMessageNotWritableException`: Usually caused by serialization issues or incorrect `Content-Type` headers.  
  - `HttpMessageConversionException`: Fixing issues with incompatible types between response bodies and expected objects.  
- Enabling detailed debugging with:  
  - Logging deserialization and serialization errors using `Slf4j` or `Log4j`.  
  - Inspecting raw API responses with `ClientHttpRequestInterceptor` or `ExchangeFilterFunction`.  

### **6. Optimizing API Performance**  
- Leveraging caching with `@Cacheable` to minimize redundant API calls.  
- Configuring GZIP compression for request/response payloads to reduce bandwidth usage.  
- Implementing rate-limiting and retry mechanisms to handle API throttling or downtime gracefully.  
- Monitoring API performance and usage with Spring Actuator and custom metrics.

## Example Use Cases  

### **Integration with Public REST APIs**  
- Handling paginated API responses (e.g., `next` and `prev` links in JSON).  
- Parsing polymorphic JSON structures with custom deserialization logic.  

### **Error Recovery and Resilience**  
- Implementing a circuit breaker pattern using Resilience4j for managing repeated failures in API responses.  
- Gracefully handling API outages with fallback methods using `@Retryable` and `@Recover`.

## Technologies Used  
- **Spring Boot** (REST APIs, WebClient, RestTemplate)  
- **Jackson** (Serialization/Deserialization)  
- **JUnit 5** and **Mock frameworks** (Unit and Integration Testing)  
- **Resilience4j** (Circuit Breaker, Retry Policies)  
- **Apache HttpClient** and **OkHttp** (REST Client Configuration)
